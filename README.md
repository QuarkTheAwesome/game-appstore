A [Chesto](https://gitlab.com/4TU/chesto)-based graphical frontend to the [get package manager](https://gitlab.com/4TU/libget) for downloading and managing homebrew on Wii U. This is a replacement to the older [Wii U Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/vgmoose/wiiu-

### Nintendo Wii U
To run this program, a Wii U with access to the Homebrew Launcher is required. This can be done on any firmware, for compatibility check at [ismywiiupatched.com](https://ismywiiupatched.com). To run the Homebrew Launcher, see the tutorial [here](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/).

Extract the latest [game-appstore](https://github.com/GuestDreemurr/game-appstore/releases) to `sd:/wiiu/apps/gamestore/`, and run "Guest's Game Store" from within Homebrew Launcher. When you're done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.
