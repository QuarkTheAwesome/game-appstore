A [Chesto](https://gitlab.com/4TU/chesto)-based graphical frontend to the [get package manager](https://gitlab.com/4TU/libget) for downloading and managing homebrew on video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. This is a replacement to the older [Wii U Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/vgmoose/wiiu-

### Nintendo Wii U
To run this program, a Wii U with access to the Homebrew Launcher is required. This can be done on any firmware, for compatibility check at [ismywiiupatched.com](https://ismywiiupatched.com). To run the Homebrew Launcher, see the tutorial [here](https://wiiuguide.xyz/).

Extract the latest [hb-appstore](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore/releases) to `sd:/wiiu/apps/appstore/`, and run "hb App Store" from within Homebrew Launcher. When you're done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.

### Web and Desktop
Web browsers can download files from the Homebrew App Store at [apps.fortheusers.org](https://apps.fortheusers.org). Source code: [hbas-frontend](https://gitlab.com/4TU/hbas-frontend)

### 3DS
universal game appstore soon
If you would like to help maintain repos for these platforms, or contribute code / ideas, please feel free to make a PR or contact us on the [4TU Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/F2PKpEj)!

## Maintaining a repo
See [get's instructions](https://github.com/vgmoose/get#setting-up-repos) for setting up a repository. Everything is designed to be statically hosted. If there's no repo provided in the `repos.json` config file, then it will generate a default one pointing to [switchbru.com/appstore](http://switchbru.com/appstore/).

If you run into any issues and need help maintaining or setting up a libget repo, feel free to get in touch with vgmoose at me@vgmoose.com or on Discord.

## Compilation instructions
This program is written using [chesto](https://gitlab.com/4TU/chesto) and has dependencies on libcurl, libget, and zlib. The chesto and libget libraries are included in this repo as submodules. SDL2 or SDL1 is also required depending on the target platform.

You can get pre-compiled binaries for each platform under [Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/4TU/hb-appstore/pipelines) for a given commit. The download artifacts dropdown is to the right of the build passing status.

### Building with Docker
The easiest way to build is using the [Spheal](https://gitlab.com/4TU/spheal) x86_64 docker container. It uses this [dependency helper script](https://gitlab.com/4TU/spheal/-/blob/master/dependency_helper.sh) to be able to build for all supported platforms. This is how the pre-compiled binaries are built.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Run the following, replacing `switch` with the target platform (one of `switch`, `wiiu`, or `pc`):
```
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/4TU/hb-appstore.git
cd hb-appstore
export PLATFORM=switch    # or wiiu, 3ds, wii, pc, pc-sdl1
docker run -v $(pwd):/code -it registry.gitlab.com/4tu/spheal /bin/bash -c "cd /code && make $PLATFORM"
```

Depending on which platform you chose, `appstore.nro` or `appstore.rpx` should now be sitting in the cloned directory.

If you are using an M1 Mac, you may have more luck running [dependency_helper.sh](https://gitlab.com/4TU/spheal/-/blob/master/dependency_helper.sh) inside of an arm64 ubuntu container, or trying the platform-specific instructions below.

### Building for Specific Platforms
Compilation instructions for specific supported platforms (Switch, Wii U, 3DS, Wii) can be found in [Compiling.md](https://gitlab.com/4TU/hb-appstore/-/blob/master/docs/Compiling.md)

## Contributing
If you have some functionality that you'd like to see feel free to discuss it on an [issues page](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore/issues), or if you already have an implementation or desire that you'd like to see, feel free to fork and make a [pull request](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore/pulls)!

For code contributions, it's not required, but running a clang-format before making a PR helps to clean up styling issues:
```
find . \( -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.hpp" \) -not -path "./libs/*" -exec clang-format -i {} \;
```
